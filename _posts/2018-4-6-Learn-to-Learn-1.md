# 1.1 Focused mode and Diffuse mode

Our brains have two modes, one is called the focus mode, the other one is called the diffuse mode. When we want to concentrate on some tough tasks, we are in the focus mode. But when we do some relaxing things, such as hiking, listening to music, we are in the diffuse mode. The focus mode made us to complete the complicated and specific tasks, but innovative thinking is easily required in the diffuse mode. The reason is behind our brains.

To make a analogy, using brain is like playing pingball game: the ball is bouncing back and forth. When under the focus mode, the bouncing pattern is very confirmed, but the bouncing scale is limited. However, when in the diffuse mode, the patern is unclear, witout rules, but the bouncing scale is very wide. The wider scale of neural connections is the reason why innovative thinking is easy from this mode.

Therefore, the best usage of our brains is to use the both modes to learn. 

- Firstly, using the focusesd mode to set the seed(the problem you want to tackle). You may can't solve the problem this time if the problem is very challenging.
- Secondly, When you feel tired, get rid of the task, do something to be relaxing, hiking, running or taking a little nap, whatever. Now you are in the diffuse mode, some inspirations may come out from your mind.
- Finally, you'd better make some notes about the innovative ideas, then go back to work to solve the problem.

# 1.2 Memory

There are two kinds of memory about our brains, working memory and long term memory. The working memory is the small memory buffer when you are doing something, it's like a broken blackboard, so its capacity is small. But the long term memory is immense, just like the warehouse store. Transforming the temporary memory into the long term memory is not an easy thing to do, it usually needs repeatitions. The process of learning is a process which transforms abstract structures from wokring memory into the long term memory. 

# 1.3 Sleeping

Sleeping is far more important then people usually thought in learning process. Ambitious guys always consider sleeping as the lazy guys' entertaining acitivity, and I have to say that the majority of elites sleep seemingly very little. However, sleeping actually does great contributions to our daily works and learning. It mainly has two functions: removing toxins from brain and optmizing memory structure. I can't interpret these two things completely, because it needs more knowledges about neural science. Simply speaking, in day time, the brain will generate many negative things(I only call them things), when we are sleeping, our brains would have chance to erase them to make brains efficiently agian. By the way, optmizing memory structure is also a mysterous process, this process can accordinate the stuff we reembered or learned in day time more reasonable. In conclusion, when we can't solve some issues in short time, just get a good sleep.
