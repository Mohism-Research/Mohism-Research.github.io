title: Learning how to learn 1 --- Focused mode and Diffuse mode
---

Our brains have two modes, one is called the focus mode, the other one is called the diffuse mode. When we want to concentrate on some tough tasks, we are in the focus mode. But when we do some relaxing things, such as hiking, listening to music, we are in the diffuse mode. The focus mode made us to complete the complicated and specific tasks, but innovative thinking is easily required in the diffuse mode. The reason is behind our brains.

To make a analogy, using brain is like playing pingball game: the ball is bouncing back and forth. When under the focus mode, the bouncing pattern is very confirmed, but the bouncing scale is limited. However, when in the diffuse mode, the patern is unclear, witout rules, but the bouncing scale is very wide. The wider scale of neural connections is the reason why innovative thinking is easy from this mode.

Therefore, the best usage of our brains is to use the both modes to learn. 

- Firstly, using the focusesd mode to set the seed(the problem you want to tackle). You may can't solve the problem this time if the problem is very challenging.
- Secondly, When you feel tired, get rid of the task, do something to be relaxing, hiking, running or taking a little nap, whatever. Now you are in the diffuse mode, some inspirations may come out from your mind.
- Finally, you'd better make some notes about the innovative ideas, then go back to work to solve the problem.
